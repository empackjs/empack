  - title: Fastify-Compatible
    details: Fully compatible with existing Fastify ecosystem â€” integrate or migrate without friction.

    details: Supports singleton, transient, and request-scoped lifecycles. Combined with lazy middleware resolution for high performance and clean structure.
  - title: Type-Safe Decorators
    details: Define routes using intuitive decorators like @Controller, @Get, and @Post, with full support for parameter binding and type inference.
