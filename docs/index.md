features:
  - title: Express-Compatible
    details: Fully compatible with existing Express middleware and ecosystem — integrate or migrate without friction.
  - title: Modular DI Architecture
    details: Supports singleton, transient, and request-scoped lifecycles. Combined with lazy middleware resolution for high performance and clean structure.
  - title: Type-Safe Decorators
    details: Define routes using intuitive decorators like @Controller, @Get, and @Post, with full support for parameter binding and type inference.
  - title: Built-in Mediator Support
    details: Implements the mediator pattern to decouple controllers from application services. Controllers focus only on input/output while business logic lives in dedicated handlers.
  - title: Automatic OpenAPI Generation
    details: Seamlessly generates complete OpenAPI specs from route and type metadata. Perfect for Swagger UI and API-first collaboration.
  - title: Lightweight
    details: Empack minimizes boilerplate and server setup overhead. Developers can focus entirely on business logic while the framework handles routing, dependency injection, validation, and documentation out of the box.
